# Pesten
This is a card game similar to UNO. It is played with two or more players. The player who's hand is empty first wins. The board has two stacks of cards, 
one to play cards at and one to draw cards from. The card being played should at least have a similar suit or value. Some cards can be set as "pest cards", that can be used 
to annoy other players. Examples of pest cards are: play another turn, next player skips a turn, player turn order gets reversered and choosing what suit the next card should have.
